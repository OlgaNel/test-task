### Detailed structure

- cypress/integration/features: Contains .feature files, written in Gherkin syntax, defining the test scenarios.

- cypress/integration/features/{featureDirName}: Contains step definition files, implementing the logic for steps in the .feature files with the same name. This allows each feature file to have its own directory of related steps.

- cypress/integration/pages: Stores page object files. These files help maintain a clean structure by abstracting page elements and actions, making tests more readable and maintainable.

- cypress/support: Contains constants and helper functions used across the project to keep tests organized and reduce redundancy.

- cypress/screenshots: Captures and stores screenshots automatically if any test fails. This is useful for debugging and reviewing test failures.
